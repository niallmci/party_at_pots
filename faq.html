                    <h3>The Basics</h3>
                    <p>The basic idea is to get all our friends and family in a pub we love and have a heap of pints. Basically this is our day 2 its just happening almost a year after our actual wedding (give us a chance to financially recover pls). It will be quite casual, but hopefully lots of fun. We'll be kicking off just after 3PM, and will be there until late.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Where should I stay?</h3>
                    <p>Most people are staying locally (Ennistymon or Lahinch) in B&Bs or otherwise. There is a nice hotel in the town that is walking distance called "The Falls Hotel", we are staying there. There are rooms reserved under our name til a few weeks before if you call them :-) If you end up getting accommodation a bit further away and are worried about transport home late at night, please get in touch and we can help.</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>Some suggestions for accommodation:</strong>

                    <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
                    <p>Whatever you like. Go stress free or go fancy. We'll be wearing our gladrags from our wedding day so you can dress up if you fancy it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Food & Drinks</h3>
                    <p>This is not a sit down meal sorta thing. Wouldn't advise arriving hungry - have a nice lunch beforehand. There'll be pizza and some other bits about.</p>
                    <p>As for drinks, yes there is a bar that has basically everything. We've promised Jack ye will spend lots of money and make him look good.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Plus Ones</h3>
                    <p>For sure, just let us know when you RSVP.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Children</h3>
                    <p>Kids are welcome - Oscar will be there! However, any child under 15 needs to head away by 9PM. Let us know if you need help finding a babysitter, we will also be looking into this ourselves.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Dietary Requirements</h3>
                    <p>Please let us know of any dietary requirements when you RSVP! We want to make sure everyone can enjoy the nibbles we'll have available.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Gifts</h3>
                    <p>No need. We would much rather you spend your money on a nice hotel room and a few extra drinks. That's what we are doing :-)</p>
                    
                    <h3>Questions?</h3>
