                    <h3>The Basics</h3>
                    <p>The basic idea is to get all our friends and family in a pub we love and have a heap of pints. Basically this is our day 2 its just happening almost a year after our actual wedding (give us a chance to financially recover pls). It will be quite casual, but hopefully lots of fun. We'll be kicking off at 3PM (welcome drink and trad band), and will be there until late.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Where should I stay?</h3>
                    <p>Most people are staying locally (Ennistymon or Lahinch) in B&Bs or otherwise. There is a nice hotel in the town that is walking distance called "The Falls Hotel", we are staying there. There are rooms reserved under our name til a few weeks before if you call them :-) If you end up getting accommodation a bit further away and are worried about transport home late at night, please get in touch and we can help.</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <strong>Some suggestions for accommodation:</strong>

                    <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
                    <p>Whatever you like. Go stress free or go fancy. We'll be wearing our gladrags from our wedding day so you can dress up if you fancy it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Food & Drinks</h3>
                    <p>This is not a formal wedding sit down meal sorta thing. At around 5PM we will be serving food in a casual buffet style. Later on there will be cakes.</p>
                    <p>As for drinks, yes there is a bar that has basically everything. We've promised Jack ye will spend lots of money and make him look good.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Plus Ones</h3>
                    <p>For sure, just let us know when you RSVP.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Children</h3>
                    <p>Kids are welcome - Oscar will be there! However, any child under 15 needs to head away by 9PM. Let us know if you need help finding a babysitter, we will also be looking into this ourselves.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Dietary Requirements</h3>
                    <p>Please let us know of any dietary requirements when you RSVP! We want to make sure everyone can enjoy the nibbles we'll have available.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Gifts</h3>
                    <p>No need. We would much rather you spend your money on a nice hotel room and a few extra drinks. That's what we are doing :-)</p>
